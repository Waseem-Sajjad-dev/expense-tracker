Expense Tracker is a responsive web application built with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Recharts**. Users can add, categorize, and visualize their expenses.

- Categorize expenses: Food, Rent, Transport, Entertainment, Other  
- Color-coded badges for categories  
- Bar chart showing total expenses per category

2. Click **Add Expense** to add it to the list.

**Deployment (GitHub Pages):**
