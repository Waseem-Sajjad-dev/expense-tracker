Expense Tracker is a responsive web application built with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Recharts**. Users can add, categorize, and visualize their expenses. Data is persisted using **localStorage**, so expenses remain after refreshing the browser. Users can also delete items and view a summary chart for quick insights.

**Features:** Add, view, and delete expenses; categorize expenses (Food, Rent, Transport, Entertainment, Other); color-coded badges for categories; bar chart showing total expenses per category; responsive design for mobile and desktop; localStorage persistence; Tailwind CSS styling with gradients and hover effects.

**Technologies Used:** React (frontend framework), Vite (fast development & build tool), Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling), Recharts (charts and data visualization), JavaScript (ES6 for logic & state management).
